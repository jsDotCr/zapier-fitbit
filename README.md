# Zapier vs. Fitbit

Fitbit integration for Zapier platform.
Not much going on for the time being, but still, it's a fun one for me!

## Scope

The scope is currently limited to `weight` (weight, body mass index, body fat percentage, and goals) and `nutrition` (calorie consumption, food/water logging, goals, and plans). Next ones up would be `profile`, `sleep`, `heartrate`, and `activity`.

## Triggers

[x] Body Fat (_weight_ scope)
[x] Body Weight (_weight_ scope)

### Up nextâ€¦

[ ] Water consumption (_nutrition_ scope)
[ ] Calories in (_nutrition_ scope)
[ ] Nutrition facts (_nutrition_ scope)

2. `npm t` to run the tests
